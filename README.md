# Vehicle Routing Problem

## Summary
The project consists in designing and writing a working VBA program that heuristically solves a vehicle routing problem (VRP) 
using stochastic optimisation techniques. Specifically, the program will read in a problem instance from a file and then will 
produce a heuristic quality solution using descent-based methods and possibly more advanced optimisation techniques. It will 
also output information to the user during and after a run, including animated graphical output.
